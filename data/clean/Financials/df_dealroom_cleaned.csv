1,"Dahua Technology is a publicly traded company that manufactures video surveillance equipment and provides video-centric AIoT solutions. Founded in 2001 by Fu Liquan and his colleagues in Hangzhou, China, the company initially focused on digital video recorders (DVRs). A significant milestone was the launch of the world's first 8-channel real-time embedded DVR in 2002. The company went public on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2008.

The founder, Fu Liquan, worked as a defense industry technician and at a state-owned electronics factory before starting his entrepreneurial journey. He and his wife, Chen Ailing, who serves on the board, reportedly sold their house to fund the company's predecessor in 2001. Fu serves as the company's chairman and holds an EMBA from Zhejiang University.

Dahua's business model revolves around the sale of hardware products and software-based solutions. Its product portfolio is extensive, including network and HDCVI cameras, recorders, PTZ cameras, thermal cameras, access control systems, alarms, and video management software. The company serves a global market across more than 180 countries, with clients in sectors such as transportation, retail, education, banking, and government. Revenue is generated primarily from the sale of its hardware products and integrated solutions, supplemented by software licensing and maintenance services. The business is organized into two core segments: City and Enterprise.

The company heavily invests in R&D, dedicating about 10% of its annual sales revenue to innovation and has established several research institutes. Key proprietary technologies include High Definition Composite Video Interface (HDCVI), an over-coax transmission technology introduced in 2012, and various AI-driven features like AcuPick for video search, WizSense, and full-color imaging for low-light conditions. The company has faced international scrutiny and sanctions from countries like the U.S., UK, and Australia due to concerns over national security, alleged backdoors in its equipment, and its connection to human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
